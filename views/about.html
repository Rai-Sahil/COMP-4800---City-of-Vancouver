        <h1>About City Of Vancouver Mural Roster</h1>
        <p>
          The City of Vancouver Mural Roster is a list of artists who have been pre-qualified to
          create murals on city property. The roster is used to streamline the artist selection
          process for public art projects.
          <br />
          The roster is open to artists who have demonstrated experience in creating murals and
          public art. Artists are selected through a review process. The roster is continuously
          updated.
          <br />
          The roster is used by the City of Vancouver and other organizations to select artists for
          mural projects. The roster is also used by property owners to find artists for private
          mural projects.
